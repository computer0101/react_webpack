# react_webpack
Starter code for react projects using webpack configuration

This is a simple webpack configuration to start developing REACT applications. 

1. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies. Once installation is completed proceed to next step.
2. To start production server run `npm dev-server:prod`.
3. To start development server run `dev-server:dev`.
4. To eject production based app.js file run `npm run prod`.
5. To eject developement based final app.js file run `npm run dev`.

**Note**: Most developers have moved to start building REACT application from scratch by using `create-react-app` command. If you are not familiar what that is feel free to read docs [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
